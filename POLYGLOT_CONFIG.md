## Configuration

The pHin Smart Water Monitor node server has the following user configuration
parameters:

- email - this is the email address you used to register with pHin. You enter/save this first and you will be prompted for the validation code that will be send to this email address
- validation code - a 5 digit code that you will receive in your inbox. Sometimes it can take several minutes before you receive this validation code email.

This node server will automatically create some new parameters. If you want to start over, you can simply delete all the parameters and the application will recreate them and prompt you to re-register this device
